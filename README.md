# Pointers Basics in C++

## Objective
To understand the concept of pointers in C++ by:

- Declaring and initializing a pointer.
- Displaying the value and address of a variable.
- Displaying the value stored in a pointer.
- Using the dereference operator to access the value stored at the pointer location.
- Pointer interaction with arrays.
- Modifying values using pointers.

## Algorithm: Understanding Pointers in C++

**Step 1:** Start  
**Step 2:** Declare an integer variable `a` and initialize it with a value (e.g., `a = 10`).  
**Step 3:** Declare a pointer variable `aptr` and assign it the address of `a` using the address-of operator `&`.  
**Step 4:** Display the following using `cout`:
- Value of `a`
- Address of `a` (i.e., `&a`)
- Value of `aptr` (which should be same as `&a`)
- Value pointed to by `aptr` using the dereference operator `*`

**Step 5:** Display:
- Address of the pointer variable `aptr`
- Size of `a`, `aptr`, and data types using `sizeof()`

**Step 6:** End

## Algorithm: Pointer Arithmetic

**Step 1:** Start  
**Step 2:** Declare integer `a` and initialize it.  
**Step 3:** Declare pointer `aptr` and store the address of `a`.  
**Step 4:** Print original address stored in `aptr`.  
**Step 5:** Increment the pointer using `aptr++`.  
**Step 6:** Print new address stored in `aptr`.  
**Step 7:** End

## Algorithm: Pointers with Arrays and Value Modification

**Step 1:** Start  
**Step 2:** Declare integer `a` and pointer `aptr` pointing to it.  
**Step 3:** Modify value of `a` via `*aptr = 20`.  
**Step 4:** Declare array `arr[] = {10, 20, 30}`.  
**Step 5:** Declare pointer `ptr` to point to first element of `arr`.  
**Step 6:** Loop from `i = 0` to `2`:
- Print value at `*ptr`.
- Increment pointer to next element.

**Step 7:** End

## Conclusion
These programs help in understanding:
- How pointers reference memory locations.
- How values can be modified using pointers.
- How pointer arithmetic and array access work in C++.

This foundational knowledge is crucial for working with dynamic memory, data structures, and system-level programming.
